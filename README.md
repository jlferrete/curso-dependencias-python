## With Managing Python Dependencies you will:

**Code at a higher level and become more efficient**: Leveraging Python’s rich third-party library ecosystem let’s you write better programs in a shorter amount of time. With a large body of freely available modules you can avoid reinventing the wheel and deliver higher quality Python software, faster. This is a great way for you to demonstrate senior level skills that will benefit your development career.

**Get up to speed with Python dependency management quickly**: Your time is your most important asset. If you can use it efficiently you will save your sanity—and a nice stack of money. This course is concise but thorough and will help you attain solid Python dependency management knowledge fast.

**Go from “writing scripts” to “building applications” with Python**: By taking advantage of Python’s rich packaging ecosystem you’ll be able to build substantial and full-featured applications in Python. You’ll know the best practices for finding and documenting application dependencies that put you right on track for deploying and shipping production-grade apps.

**Find great libraries for a specific task at hand**: This course teaches you a unique 7-step workflow for finding and identifying quality Python packages. Find out which libraries and tools are available on PyPI to help you. By quickly and easily identifying the correct libraries you’ll speed up your development efficiency by a large margin. Meet your deadlines and write better code at the same time by not having to “reinvent the wheel.”

**Master “the tools of the trade” for dependency management**: With this course you’ll master the tools and workflows recommended by the official Python Packaging Authority. By getting those skills under your belt you’ll be ready to work with the Python development and production environments used by professional development teams across the world. Knowing these “tools of the trade” by heart puts you at an advantage in any job interview situation.

**“Productionize” your projects and share them with the world**: You’ll see how to apply the best practices for defining and installing package dependencies in Python. You’ll know how to get your programs ready to be deployed on production and automated testing environments and how to make it easy for other developers to contribute code with minimal setup effort.

**Become more valuable as an employee and team member**: With my detailed 7-step workflow for researching quality Python packages you’ll know how to document and justify added program dependencies to your team and your manager. By taking on more responsibilities and picking up these senior-level “architectural” skills you’ll rise head and shoulders above other devs stuck at the “code monkey” level.
